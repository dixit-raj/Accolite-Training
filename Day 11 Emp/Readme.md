# 🧾 Employee Task Tracker System

A modular Java console application to manage employees and their tasks. It supports task assignment, status updates, searching, sorting, and background monitoring for overdue tasks. Built using object-oriented principles and designed for easy interaction through a text-based menu system.

## 📌 Core Modules

### ✅ 1. Employee Management

* Add new employees with auto-generated IDs.
* Store employee name and department.

### ✅ 2. Task Assignment

* Assign tasks to employees using a unique task ID.
* Input task description, due date, and priority (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`).

### ✅ 3. Task Status Update

* Update the status of a task to `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `COMPLETED`.
* Task lookup is done using task ID.

### ✅ 4. Task Retrieval & Display

* View all tasks assigned to a specific employee.
* Retrieve overdue tasks and tasks due tomorrow.

### ✅ 5. Task Search & Sorting

* Search tasks globally by description keyword.
* Sort tasks for an employee by:

  * Due Date

### ✅ 6. Analytics

* Identify employees with more than three pending tasks.

### ✅ 7. Background Monitoring

* A separate thread (`TaskMonitor`) checks for overdue tasks during execution and prints alerts.
